# Coding for Crypto

This is the repository in which a set of examples, problems, and solutions will be kept for a crash course on using Sage (and complimentary packages) for (post-quantum) cryptography.

## Prerequisites:

- An IDE (eg. vscode) _if you are familiar with Jupyter and would prefer that, then this can be skipped._
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Sage Maths](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html) _No development necessary._

If you have any troubles installing any of the above, let me know and I can lend a hand.

I assume the reader has basic familiarity with Python, its syntax, and general programming constructs (loops, conditionals, variables, etc.). Again, if you don't think that this is you, let me know and I can give you some resources for this (and can go through it with you in the session quickly).

See:

for more on Python.
